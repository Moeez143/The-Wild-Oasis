Application Flow
Key Architectural Patterns

1. Context + Hooks for State
   Dark Mode: Global theme toggle (stored in localStorage)
   Custom Hooks: useUser, useBookings, useBooking, useCabins, etc.
2. React Query for Server State
   Handles API calls to Supabase
   Automatic caching & refetching
   Real-time mutations (create, update, delete)
3. Component Organization
   Smart Components (pages + feature hooks): Handle data logic
   Dumb Components (ui/): Display data with props
4. Error Handling
   Error Boundary: Catches crashes & shows fallback UI
   Toast Notifications: User feedback for actions
5. Dark Mode
   Uses CSS classes (dark-mode, light-mode)
   CSS variables for theme colors
   Persisted in localStorage
   Database (Supabase)
   The app connects to a Supabase PostgreSQL database with tables for:

users: Staff/admin accounts
bookings: Guest reservations
cabins: Property listings
guests: Guest information
settings: App configuration
Deployment on Vercel
Built with Vite → optimized production bundle
SPA (Single Page App) → needs vercel.json for routing (which we just created!)
Environment: Uses Supabase URLs/keys (public keys are safe in frontend)
